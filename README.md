Solutions to problems from Reuven Lerner's book [Python Workout](https://www.manning.com/books/python-workout)

*I have thoroughly enjoyed solving through the problems in this book, particularly because of how much it forces me to learn the standard library and exposes me to infinitely many concepts in pure computer science.*

*You do have to pay for access to the book, but it's been a lot of fun for me trying to solve seemingly simple problems in ways I have never done so before.*
